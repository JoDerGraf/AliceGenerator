AliceGenerator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/trappar/AliceGenerator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trappar/AliceGenerator)
===========

Recursively convert existing objects into [Alice](https://github.com/nelmio/alice) Fixtures.

## Why?

Sometimes you find yourself working on a large project with no existing fixtures.
In this case even though Alice makes fixtures much easier to write, that process can still be tedious.

This library proposes an alternate starting point - *automatically generate fixtures from your existing data.*

This opens up a whole new, much faster way to get your test data established... just enter it in your user interface!

## How?

More detail will be added heres shortly.
